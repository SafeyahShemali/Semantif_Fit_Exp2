serve,plate,"The Instrument role typically refers to the entity that is used by the agent to perform the action denoted by the predicate.It is often something tangible or concrete that facilitates the completion of the task.In the context of the predicate 'serve', the Instrument would be the means or tool through which service is provided.The Instrument can be a physical object, such as a tray or utensils used to serve food, or it can be more abstract, such as a software or system used to provide a service.The Instrument is not the recipient of the action, but rather the conduit or mechanism by which the action is carried out.","The argument 'plate' is a tangible object that can be used to carry, present, or hold food.It facilitates the action of serving by being the item on which food is placed and then delivered to someone.A plate is a common instrument in the context of serving food, making it a semantically appropriate fit for the Instrument role with the predicate 'serve'.It is not the agent performing the action, nor the recipient of the action, but the means by which the action is accomplished.","The argument 'plate' is a highly appropriate fit for the Instrument role in the context of the predicate 'serve'.A plate is a common tool used to carry or present food, which aligns well with the action of serving.The use of a plate as an instrument in serving is culturally and practically established, making it semantically compatible.",5.9,1.0
serve,tray,"The Instrument role for the predicate 'serve' typically refers to the entity that is used to perform the action of serving.It is often a tool, device, or means through which the action of serving is carried out.The Instrument should be capable of being employed by an Agent to achieve the goal of the action.It should be something that facilitates or is directly involved in the process of serving.The Instrument is not the recipient of the action, but rather the enabler or conduit for the action.","A tray is a flat surface with raised edges designed for carrying items, which makes it suitable for holding and transporting food or drinks.It is a common tool used in the context of serving food and beverages, aligning well with the action implied by the predicate 'serve'.The tray enables an Agent (e.g., a waiter or someone serving food) to carry multiple items at once, facilitating the serving process.It is directly involved in the serving action as it holds the items being served, making it an appropriate Instrument for the predicate 'serve'.","A tray is a typical instrument used to carry and present food or drinks, which is directly related to the action of serving.The tray facilitates the serving process by allowing multiple items to be carried at once, which is a common function in serving scenarios.The use of a tray is contextually appropriate as it is commonly associated with the act of serving in various settings such as restaurants, cafes, and events.",6.5,0.75
serve,glass,"The Instrument role typically refers to the entity that is used by the agent to perform the action denoted by the predicate.In the context of the predicate 'serve', an Instrument would be the means or tool through which the service is provided.The Instrument is not the recipient of the action, but rather the conduit or mechanism that facilitates the action.For the predicate 'serve', the Instrument could be physical, such as a tray or a computer, or abstract, such as a system or method.The Instrument is often optional in a sentence; the action can usually occur without explicitly mentioning the Instrument.The Instrument can sometimes be confused with the Agent, but it is important to note that the Agent is the doer of the action, while the Instrument is what the Agent uses to carry out the action.","The argument 'glass' is a tangible object that can be used to hold a beverage or other substance for consumption.It can be employed by an agent (e.g., a waiter) to perform the action of serving a drink to a recipient.The 'glass' serves as a medium through which the service is provided, aligning with the typical function of an Instrument role.It is a passive element in the action, being manipulated by the agent to accomplish the task of serving.The 'glass' is not performing the action of serving but is essential for the completion of the serving action in a typical dining or drinking context.","The argument 'glass' is a highly suitable Instrument for the predicate 'serve' when the context involves serving a beverage.A 'glass' is a common tool used in the act of serving drinks, which aligns well with the expected function of an Instrument in such a scenario.The 'glass' facilitates the action of serving by being the container from which a beverage can be consumed.In typical serving situations, a 'glass' is a conventional and expected Instrument, making it semantically appropriate for the role.",4.9,0.75
serve,platter,"The Instrument role typically refers to the entity that is used by the agent to perform the action of the predicate.In the context of the predicate 'serve', an Instrument would be the means or tool through which the service is provided.The Instrument can be a physical object, such as a tray or utensils used to serve food, or it can be more abstract, such as a software or system used to provide a service.The Instrument is not the recipient of the action, but rather the conduit or facilitator of the action.","The argument 'platter' is a physical object commonly used to hold or present food.It facilitates the action of serving by providing a surface on which food items can be placed and easily carried or presented to others.The platter is not the agent performing the action, nor the recipient of the action, but rather the means by which the action is accomplished.It is typically used in a context where food is being served to one or more individuals.","The argument 'platter' fits well with the Instrument role for the predicate 'serve' because it is a tool commonly used to carry and present food, which is a central aspect of serving.A platter is directly involved in the action of serving as it holds the items being served, making it an appropriate and effective instrument for this action.The use of a platter is typical and expected in scenarios where food is served, indicating a strong semantic fit between the argument 'platter' and the Instrument role in the context of the predicate 'serve'.",5.8,0.75
serve,bucket,"The Instrument role typically refers to the entity that is used by the agent to perform the action denoted by the predicate.It is often something tangible or concrete that can be manipulated or employed to achieve a particular goal.In the context of the predicate 'serve', the Instrument would be the means or tool through which the service is provided.The Instrument can sometimes be an abstract concept or method if it is the means by which the action is carried out.It is not the recipient of the action, but rather the facilitator or medium for the action.","The argument 'bucket' as an Instrument in the context of the predicate 'serve' suggests that the bucket is being used as a tool or container to provide or deliver something.A bucket can hold or carry items, which means it can be used to serve substances such as water, food, or other materials.The bucket is a tangible object that can be manipulated by an agent to perform the action of serving.The bucket's properties of containment and portability make it suitable for serving purposes in various contexts.","The bucket is a tangible object that can contain and transport materials, making it suitable as a means to serve.It can be used by an agent to carry and deliver contents to others, fulfilling the action denoted by 'serve'.Its properties of containment and portability align with the functional requirements of an Instrument in the context of serving.",1.4,0.75
