Overall, the rifle is a versatile and reliable weapon that can be used for various purposes, which is also a characteristic of the Instrument role.",0.9

The cannon is a mechanical device that uses a force generated by explosive reactions to propel a projectile out of its barrel. The cannon can be used to shoot a variety of projectiles, including bullets, shells, and other types of ammunition. The cannon is an instrument that is used to perform the action of shooting, and it is a relevant argument for the predicate 'shoot'.",0.9
